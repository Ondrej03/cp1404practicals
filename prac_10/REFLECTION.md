# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks 

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually quite accurate, sometimes I got stuck with some tasks and then it took longer

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I got more accurate during the course, but still I could not predict if I would get stuck on some functionality or error.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That it is very hard to correctly estimate a task duration, especially when it comes to more complex code

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Not much, usually I did not received any feedback or just a very short one. I got maybe only one that included some meaningful advices.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I improved my ability to read others code

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 9 feedback](https://github.com/Dajin-01/cp1404practicals-/pull/5)

### Explanation

I warned the students about the errors he had and about syntax violations he made. I also provided him some tips how he can make his code better. 
To not stay only negative, I also picked some parts that he did really well and praised him for that. At the end i provided a short summary and encouraged him
into more work.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 6 feedback](https://github.com/Yuchen513/cp1404practicals/pull/4#discussion_r1835382846)

### Explanation

The code of my classmate was quite good, so there were no major mistakes. Still, I found some spots that could be improved and I warned him about them.
I also provided him some tips for improvement and at the end I told him that he did a good job and praised him so he would be motivated into next pracs.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Probably nothing, I really like the section were there were the obligatory parts, and then you could do more if you wanted to improve

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did quite nice code reviews for others, I finished almost everything on time and I think I understood everything what was explained in the classes
