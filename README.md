## Key Lessons in Clean Code

Through this project, Iâ€™ve learned several  lessons about writing clean code:

- **Readability is Key**: Code has to be easy to read and understand
- **Keep It Simple**: We should avoid unnecessary complexity 
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming should be easy to understand
